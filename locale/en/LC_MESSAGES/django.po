#Seccion 1

msgid "tem1"
msgstr "Library of ReportBro Designer"

msgid "tem1_parr1"
msgstr "Designer is a JavaScript plugin that can be integrated into your web application. Although this requires a little more work at first, having a built-in template design tool has quite a few benefits as you will discover by reading. Installation is simple by including some JavaScript libraries and initializing the Designer with some HTML and JavaScript code."

msgid "tem1_parr2"
msgstr "It is optimized for simple reporting, that is, to display data (text, tabular data, or images) exactly as defined in a design template. All parameters are passed directly to the report and therefore <b>ReportBro </b> does not require knowledge of SQL (or another query language) to create a report. In contrast, using the same data requests in the underlying web application and for reporting eliminates the risk of potential inconsistencies between the data displayed on the screen and the printed report."


msgid "tem1_parr3"
msgstr "<b> ReportBro</b> allows you to easily and quickly design reports with a perfect design. Printing the current page in the footer is as simple as inserting predefined variables for the current page and total page count. Even to generate Excel outputs no additional configuration is needed because ReportBro has a very clear structure and is easy to learn."



msgid "tem2"
msgstr "Library of reportbro-lib"

msgid "tem2_parr1"
msgstr "<b> ReportBro-lib</b> is a library for generating PDF and XLSX reports written in Python for use in conjunction with <b>Django</b>. Report templates can be created with <b>ReportBro Designer</b>, a Javascript plugin that can be integrated into your web application."

msgstr "ReportBro Admin"

msgid "tem3_parr1"
msgstr "<b>A free project that unites the JavaScript libraries of ReportBro designer and the reportbro-lib library.</b>"
